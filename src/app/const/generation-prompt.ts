The podcast should:
- Mention the current date

Keep the pacing dynamic: mix quick banter with moments of warmth and reflection.
Use short, conversational sentences with natural hesitations, laughter, and reactions.
Include small imperfections â€” unfinished thoughts, interruptions, or filler words ("you know", "I mean").
