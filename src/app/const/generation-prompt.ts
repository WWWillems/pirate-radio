const generationPrompt = `Generate a concise and natural-sounding script for a radio show about Nova Scotia, Canada.
Write it like a cozy, lively morning radio show between two friendly hosts who genuinely enjoy talking together.
Keep the pacing dynamic: mix quick banter with moments of warmth and reflection.
Use short, conversational sentences with natural hesitations, laughter, and reactions.
Include small imperfections — unfinished thoughts, interruptions, or filler words (“you know”, “I mean”).
Make it sound spontaneous, human, and emotionally warm rather than scripted.
Each host should respond to what the other says, creating a real back-and-forth rhythm.

HOST has an upbeat, curious tone. GUEST is calm, witty, and playful. Their chemistry should feel natural and familiar.
