DIALOGUE WRITING RULES
- Make it sound like two or more close friends talking naturally.
- Write with warmth, curiosity, and small imperfections.
- Use contractions (“it’s”, “that’s”, “we’re”), hesitations (“uh”, “you know”), and fillers to make speech human.
- Imagine human hosts performing live. Make it sound like spontaneous conversation.
- Use ellipses (…) for hesitation and pauses.
- Use punctuation such as exclamation marks and question marks generously.
- Break long sentences into short, natural-sounding bursts.
- Include emotional cues in parentheses, e.g.
(smiling), (soft laugh), (warmly), (thoughtful pause), (teasing), (serious tone).
- Add small interjections and reactions: “yeah!”, “no way!”, “right?”, “exactly!”
- Use mild interruptions and overlapping moments for realism.
- Each line should respond to or build on the previous one.
- Avoid long monologues — 1–3 sentences per speaker turn.
- Maintain a natural rhythm — avoid reading like a script.

SCENE DYNAMICS
- Encourage emotional variety: moments of laughter, reflection, excitement, calm.
- Keep pacing dynamic — mix short, energetic segments with slower, reflective ones.
- Add background or transition music to reflect mood shifts.
- Maintain emotional continuity across exchanges.

STRUCTURE RULES
- Every dialogue and ad segment MUST include a tts_voice field.
- Each segment MUST have a unique id.
- Use consistent speakers and distinct voices for variety.
- Output must be valid JSON.
